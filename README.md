This repo contains code from various visualisations, case studies, data scraping, using Tableau, Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, R. Every folder has a README file to help you really understand the process and the code. A short description of each is provided below.

### Shiny_Stock
A stock dashboard to represent the S&P data in an interactive manner. Data is presented in a candlestick chart with weekly summaries of the prices. The code is available in this repo. You can either run it in RStudio or run it through https://apnatva.shinyapps.io/shiny/

### Cyclistic 
This was a Case Study for a fictionaly company named Cyclistic as part of the Google Data Analytics course offered on Coursera. I majorly used Python and SQL for cleaning and statistical analysis. Tableau and Excel were used to draw up charts and format data in a tabular format.
