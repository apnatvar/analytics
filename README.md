# analytics
This repo contains code from various visualisations, case studies, data scraping, using Tableau, Spreadsheets, SQL, Python, R. Every folder has a README file to help you really understand the process and the code. A short description of each is provided below.

### Shiny_Stock
A stock dashboard to represent the S&P data in an interactive manner. Data is presented in a candlestick chart with weekly summaries of the prices. The code is available in this repo. You can either run it in RStudio or run it through https://apnatva.shinyapps.io/shiny/

### Cyclistic 
This was a Case Study for a fictionaly company named Cyclistic as part of the Google Data Analytics course offered on Coursera. I majorly used Python and SQL for cleaning and statistical analysis. Tableau and Excel were used to draw up charts and format data in a tabular format.

### Dublinbnb
This is an exploratory visualisation excercise in R. THe aim was to visualise as much data as possible using various plots and techniques to fully explore libraries like ggplot2, mapview, dplyr etc. The script also serves as a reference for future scripting in R to visualise histograms, bar plots, and pie charts etc.
